# Sentiment-Analysis-Model
This project is a Sentiment Analysis Model developed using Python and various data science libraries like matplotlib, scikit-learn, seaborn on the Google Colab platform. The model is designed to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments with an accuracy of 85%.
<br>

<b>Key Features:

<b>Platform: Google Colab
<b>Programming Language: Python
<b> Libraries Used:
<b>1. Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
<br>2. NumPy: For numerical computations.
<br>3. Scikit-Learn: For building the machine learning model, including data preprocessing, vectorization, and model evaluation.
<br>4. Matplotlib & Seaborn : For visualizing the data and model performance.
<br>

<b>Model Overview:</b>
<br>**Data Source: The dataset used for training the model was processed and cleaned using Pandas, ensuring the data was in a suitable format for analysis.
<br>**Feature Extraction: Text data was converted into numerical form using techniques like TF-IDF,  CountVectorizer.
<br>**Model: Various machine learning algorithms were tested, with the final model being chosen based on performance metrics. The model was trained and evaluated on the dataset, achieving an accuracy of 85%.
<br>**Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation was also employed to ensure robustness

<b>How to Run the Model:</b>
<br>1. Clone the Repository: 
            <br>git clone https://github.com/usha-madithati/Sentiment-Analysis-Model
            <br>cd sentiment-analysis-model
<br>2. Dependencies : Install the required python packages:
          pip install -r requirements.txt( install all the required packages like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
<br>3. Run the model : Execute the google colab or Jupyter Notebook to see the model in action
         Upload the "Sentiment-Analysis.ipynb" notebook to colab, install all the required dependencies and run all cells to execuete the model.
         
<b>Results:<\b>
<br> 1. The model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test dataset.
<br> 2. Detailed performance metrics and confusion matrix are provided in the notebook.

<b>Future Enhancements:</b>
     **Improve model accuracy by experimenting with advanced techniques like word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) and deep learning models.
     **Expand the dataset to include more diverse text samples for better generalization.
     
<b>Conclusion:</b>
        This Sentiment Analysis Model serves as a foundational implementation for understanding the basics of text classification using machine learning. It can be further enhanced and deployed in real-world applications requiring sentiment detection.
