# Sentiment-Analysis-Model
This project is a Sentiment Analysis Model developed using Python and various data science libraries like matplotlib, scikit-learn, seaborn on the Google Colab platform. The model is designed to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments with an accuracy of 85%.
<br>

<b>Key Features:
<b>Platform: Google Colab
<b>Programming Language: Python
<b> Libraries Used:
<b>1. Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
<br>2. NumPy: For numerical computations.
<br>3. Scikit-Learn: For building the machine learning model, including data preprocessing, vectorization, and model evaluation.
<br>4. Matplotlib & Seaborn : For visualizing the data and model performance.
<br>
<b>Model Overview:</b>
<br>**Data Source: The dataset used for training the model was processed and cleaned using Pandas, ensuring the data was in a suitable format for analysis.
<br>**Feature Extraction: Text data was converted into numerical form using techniques like TF-IDF,  CountVectorizer.
<br>**Model: Various machine learning algorithms were tested, with the final model being chosen based on performance metrics. The model was trained and evaluated on the dataset, achieving an accuracy of 85%.
<br>**Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation was also employed to ensure robustness.
